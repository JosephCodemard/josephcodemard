## Hi, I'm Joseph


I'm a first year Physics Undergraduate (MPhys) at the University of Bath!
I have an interest in modelling physical systems using python and C++, and machine learning using pytorch.


I have experience with 
- Python (currently looking at machine learning using pytorch)
- C++ (and some C)
- Javascript and Typescript (NodeJS, React)
- C# and Unity
